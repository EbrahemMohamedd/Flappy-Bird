# Flappy-Bird
Here is a detailed explanation of my thought process during the development of Flappy Bird:
The goal was to create a simple yet highly engaging game with intuitive controls. I focused on minimalistic design and smooth mechanics to ensure accessibility for all players. Through iterative testing, I refined the difficulty curve to maintain a balance between challenge and fun, making every attempt feel rewarding.

First, I needed to define the core mechanics of Flappy Bird to ensure an engaging yet simple gameplay experience. This step was crucial in creating a game that was easy to learn but difficult to master. I quickly identified that the primary interaction should revolve around a single controlâ€”tapping to keep the bird airborne while avoiding obstacles.

Next, I focused on refining the game physics to create a smooth and responsive feel. This involved adjusting gravity, jump height, and collision detection to strike a balance between challenge and playability. I tested various values to ensure that the game was neither too easy nor too frustrating.

Once the mechanics were set, I worked on optimizing the level design. I experimented with different pipe placements and gaps to create a difficulty curve that kept players engaged. Randomization was also introduced to make each playthrough unique while maintaining fairness.

To evaluate the game's overall experience, I conducted multiple playtests, adjusting parameters based on player feedback. In the end, I finalized the best settings for gravity and obstacle spacing to ensure an addictive and rewarding gameplay loop.
