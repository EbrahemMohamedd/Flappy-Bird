# Flappy-Bird
Here is a detailed explanation of my thought process during the development of Flappy Bird:
The goal was to create a simple yet highly engaging game with intuitive controls. I focused on minimalistic design and smooth mechanics to ensure accessibility for all players. Through iterative testing, I refined the difficulty curve to maintain a balance between challenge and fun, making every attempt feel rewarding.
